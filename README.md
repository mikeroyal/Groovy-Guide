## Tools

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an IDE for Java, but it also understands and provides intelligent coding assistance for a large variety of other languages such as Kotlin, SQL, JPQL, HTML, JavaScript, etc., even if the language expression is injected into a String literal in your Java code.

[Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle) is a build automation tool that supports multi-language development. If you're building, testing, publishing, and deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging code to publishing web sites. Gradle is designed to support build automation across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++, Swift, and Groovy, and is closely integrated with development tools and continuous integration servers including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Jenkins.

[Groovy Language Server](https://github.com/prominic/groovy-language-server) is a [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) protocol for [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/).

[Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/languages/groovy-language.html) is an Open Source integration framework that supports Groovy along with other Scripting Languages to allow an Expression or Predicate to be used in the DSL or [Xml Configuration](https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/xml-configuration.html).

[Gradle Kotlin DSL converter](https://github.com/bernaferrari/GradleKotlinConverter) is a tool that converts from Groovy to Kotlin DSL for Gradle in Android Studio.

[Rest-assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured) is a Java DSL for easy testing of REST services.

[Spock](https://github.com/spockframework/spock) is a BDD-style developer testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy applications. 

[Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language.

[Nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow) is a bioinformatics workflow manager that enables the development of portable and reproducible workflows. It supports deploying workflows on a variety of execution platforms including local, HPC schedulers, AWS Batch, Google Cloud Life Sciences, and Kubernetes. Additionally, it provides support for manage your workflow dependencies through built-in support for Conda, Docker, Singularity, and Modules.

[Dex : The Data Explorer](https://github.com/PatMartin/Dex) is a data visualization tool written in Java/Groovy/JavaFX capable of powerful ETL and publishing web visualizations.

[Groovy-Eclipse](https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse) is a project that provides Eclipse and Maven tooling support for the Apache Groovy programming language.
